# StudyStreak

StudyStreak is a minimal study and chapter tracker that helps you decide what to revise next and keeps your sessions tightly time-boxed so work does not expand to fill all the time available.  

## Overview

The app lets you create chapters for any subject, track when you last revised them, and rate how well you understand each one.  
You can then start focused study sessions by picking specific chapters and setting a fixed duration, so you commit to getting meaningful work done inside a clear time window based on the idea that work expands to fill the time it is given
